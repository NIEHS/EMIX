# EMIX
Repository of statistical methods for environmental mixtures analyses in epidemiology.

## Description

Repository of statistical methods for environmental mixtures analyses in epidemiology. Aligns with a workflow for methods identification and information presented in Joubert et al., 2025 (EHP, provisionally accepted; see medRxiv citation below). Methods can be updated, and new methods added by original methodologists. To do this, download and edit the table, then submit a push request to update. The update will be reviewed by NIEHS staff prior to final updates.
