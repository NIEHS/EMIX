# EMIX
Repository of statistical methods for environmental mixtures analyses in epidemiology.

## Description

Repository of statistical methods for environmental mixtures analyses in epidemiology. Aligns with a workflow for methods identification and information presented in Joubert et al., medRxiv 2024 (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.20.24318087). Methods can be updated, and new methods added by original methodologists. To do this, download and edit the table, then submit a push request. The update will be reviewed by NIEHS staff prior to final updates.
